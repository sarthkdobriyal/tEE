# T-Shirt Designer with AI-Powered Design Generation
This is a web application built using React, Three.js, Express, OpenAI's Dall-E API, Tailwind, and Valtio that allows users to design their custom t-shirts using a 3D model and AI-generated designs.



# Features
- Customizable 3D T-Shirt Model: The application includes a 3D model of a t-shirt that can be customized with different colors and designs. Users can rotate the model in 3D space to see their design from different angles.

- Upload Image as Logo or Print: Users can upload their own images that can be used as logos or prints on the t-shirt. The application supports various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and SVG.

- AI-Powered Design Generation: The application uses OpenAI's Dall-E API to generate designs or logos based on user prompts. Users can write a prompt for a design or a logo, and the AI will create an image that can be used on the t-shirt.

- Responsive and User-Friendly UI: The application features a responsive and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to customize their t-shirts and generate designs.
